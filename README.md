## BITWISE-OPERATIONS
1.  Write a program for the following one.
      a) Set a bit      b) Clear a bit    c) Toggle a  bit  

2. WAP to find the given number is even or odd using bitwise operators.

3.  WAP to find the given number is +ve or -ve using bitwise operators.

4.  WAP to swap two numbers using bitwise operators.

5. WAP to find the given number is power of 2 or not.

6. WAP to find the given number is divisble by 8 or not using bitwise operators.

7. Write a program to rotate the bits. Input  the no.of  rotations, at runtime.
    Ex : binary  :  10000000000000000000000000001011
            rotations : suppose 3 times right,  then
    	result    :  01110000000000000000000000000001

           binary  :  10000000000000000000000000001011
           rotations : suppose 4 times left,  then
	result :   00000000000000000000000010111000

8. Convert the characters Upper to Lower and Lower to Upper using bitwise
    operators.

9.  Write a program to reverse the bits of a given number.
     Note : not just reverse printing.

10. Write a one line code to compare two numbers equal or not using bitwise operators.

11. Write a program to print float binay formation using char *ptr.

12. Write a program to swap the adjucent bytes of  a given 4-digit hexadecimal
      number.
      Ex : given number  = 0x1234;
	      after swap :      0x3412;

13. Write a program to delete no.of  bits from particular position in a given number.
       Input the no.of bits, at runtime.
        Ex:  Suppose  num  =  100;
		         It's Binaray is     00000000000000000000000001100100
		         delete 2 bits from 4th position
		         then result   is     00000000000000000000000000011100

14. Write a programme for swapping first and last nibbles in a given integer.
      Ex: Suppose num = 10

      It's Binary is    0000000000000000000000000001010
      After swap       1010000000000000000000000000000

15. Write a logic to extract  P bits from Posion N in an integer M

16. Write a macro to clear a bit at the position N in an integer M.

17. There are 48 bits are stored in an array of character buffer and store them into 2 integer variables.
